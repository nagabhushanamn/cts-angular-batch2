   on every DOM eleement , which are having directives/expression , will register
   'watch' expressions ( listeners ).
   
   'watch' expression - read/write model property when model is dirty.
   
   
   
   In Angular , we can also register our 'custom' watch expressions.
   
   
   all 'watch' expressions are executed by 'digest-loop' more efficiently
